# Introduction

## Why R Markdown and reproducible reports?

All good data analysis should be reproducible.  Markdown is a popular variant 
of the syntax often used in Wikis, such as Wikipedia.  R Markdown is an 
extension of Markdown to support the execution and rendering of R code within 
the document.  It integrates easily with R to allow you to produce reproducible 
reports.  We will use these tools and reproducible research practices to support 
your development in this course.  

## What is Markdown, and why bother?

Just like an R script is better than typing code in the console, using R 
Markdown is better than using an R script.  R Markdown documents allow you to 
save your code, the output that corresponds to your code, and a record of how 
each calculation and figure was created.  Not only will this help you with the 
homework for this class, it's good practice for doing reproducible research. 

Although a `.Rmd` document looks a lot different from an R script, the basics of 
R Markdown are straightforward compared to the rest of R.  After you become 
familiar with the tricks of R Markdown, you may find it easier and faster to 
use than an R script.

## How to use Markdown
The output (e.g. `.html` or `.pdf`) and source (`.Rmd`) documents are optimally 
used side-by-side so that you can see both the code and its result.  Before you 
knit this yourself, you will need to install the packages `rmarkdown` and 
`knitr`.  (These are already installed on UW-supported RStudio servers.)


# Getting started with R and RStudio

## Log onto RStudio Server

In ENVH 556 we will ensure that all applications and labs work on either of 2 UW 
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) servers running on virtual Linux machines:

  * Plasmid, for DEOHS and EPI students: [plasmid.deohs.washington.edu](https://plasmid.deohs.washington.edu/).
  * SPH server, for all students: [rstudio.sph.washington.edu](https://rstudio.sph.washington.edu/)

For either of these UW servers you will need to install and sign into [Husky OnNet VPN](https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/uw-networks/about-husky-onnet/) using your
UW NetID.

Another (non-UW) RStudio server option is [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).

## Install applications locally on your computer

You are welcome to do your work locally on your laptop, but we will not be able 
to provide support for local installations.  You will need the most recent 
version of RStudio and R.  An easy way to do this is to follow directions on a 
tutorial program (Swirl) which begins by walking you through the process of 
downloading R and RStudio.  Here is the link to the Swirl tutorial: 
[https://swirlstats.com/students.html](https://swirlstats.com/students.html). The 
first few Swirl lessons cover the "Basics of R Programming" which may help new 
R users become familiar with R and RStudio.

To work locally, make sure you have installed the `rmarkdown` package.  For this 
document, you will also need to install `knitr`.  If, at any point during this 
process, R tells you that you need to install other packages, do so.

## Become familiar with R and RStudio

The rest of this document focuses on using R Markdown in the course. We assume 
you are already familiar with R and RStudio. If not, there are many resources 
availabile to learn R and RStudio. Here are a few suggestions:

  * The [R for Data Science (R4DS)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley 
  Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.
  * An R ["Onramp"](https://github.com/deohs/r_onramp/blob/master/README.md) 
  made for beginners by the DEOHS [Coders Group](https://github.com/deohs/coders). 
    + Within the [Resources and getting help](https://github.com/deohs/r_onramp/blob/master/r_resources_and_getting_help.md) 
    section, there are many courses, tutorials, and books we suggest.

# Getting Started with R Markdown

To open a new R Markdown document (`.Rmd`), select 'File', 'New File', 
'R Markdown'.  You will see a window asking you for some information about your 
document; R will use this information to fill in some code in the `.Rmd` file, 
which you can change at any time.  For now, leave the default HTML setting and 
fill in whatever you want for the title and author.  Save this file, just like 
you would save an R script.

The following text is included in new R Markdown documents you create:

> This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for 
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown 
see <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 

> When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes 
> both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the 
> document. 

Every time you open a new `.Rmd` file, you will see this example.  To turn this
code into a nice document, press the 'knit' button at the top of the panel.  A
window will pop up with the knitted document.  Every time you knit a document,
in addition to showing you the preview in R, it will save the knitted document
in the same location as the `.Rmd` file.

You can run code line-by-line from the `.Rmd` document as you build it.
However, this runs in a different environment than the one used by `knitr`. So
you may have different errors in each.  It can be helpful to knit often.

Here are several good R Markdown resources from [RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to help you get started: 

  * The [Website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
  * The [Reference Guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
  * The [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
  * The [Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

The post [Getting Started with R Markdown â€” Guide and Cheatsheet](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/07/getting-started-with-r-markdown-guide-and-cheatsheet/) 
on R-bloggers is also very helpful.


# Anatomy of a `.Rmd` file

## YAML header

The header is enclosed by dashes and is always at the top of the `.Rmd` file. By
default, it will include a title, author, date, and what type of file the `.Rmd`
will knit to.  You can change the text of the title, author, and date here any
time.  These will show up at the  top of your knitted document.  You can also
change the file type at any time.  For example, replacing `html_document`
with `word_document`, will render a Word file.  However, be aware that some
commands are specific to certain document types, or just show up differently. It
appears that `html_document` is the most flexible and least fussy type of
output.

Whenever you open a new `.Rmd` file and see the example, leave the header and 
delete the rest of the example below the last `---`.  

## Text

To put plain text into an R Markdown document, you don't need anything special.
Text that is black in the `.Rmd` document is plain text in the knitted document.
Blue text in the `.Rmd` indicates that it has been formatted in some way by
using special characters (for example, the knitted text may be bold).  Part II
of this document gives details on how to format text.

## Chunks

Interspersed in the text are lines of code; these may have a shaded  background
in your `.Rmd` file; these are called 'chunks'.  Chunks start with ` ```{r} `
and end with ` ``` `, each at the beginning of the line.  The position of each
chunk determines where its output ends up in the knitted document.  We can
control what the code and output of each  chunk look like by changing 'chunk
options'. If we removed all the text from a `.Rmd`, the chunks would make up the
complete R script for that analysis.  (The code appendix does this for you
automatically; see below.)

Here is an example code chunk to generate some data and calculate its mean:

```{r example_chunk}
#-----example chunk-----------

# Code goes here; output appears below.  (Details about the code in this chunk
# are in Part II.)
set.seed(45)
a <- rnorm(mean=0, sd=2, n=20)
mean(a)

```

There is more information on chunks in Part II.

# R Markdown strategies to enhance reproducibility

Reproducible reports with embedded data analyses have many benefits, including:

  * Eliminates typos and transcription errors by pulling results directly from R

  * Automatically updates your results if you change other code (i.e. if I decided
to remove one observation from my data set, I wouldn't have to re-type all my
numbers)

  * Creates a record of exactly how you calculated every number (so another 
scientist could easily reproduce your entire analysis, and you will never 
forget how you calculated something)

In the remainder of this section, we suggest strategies that support
reproducibility.

## Use Rstudio projects

An important principle is to keep your scripts, data files, and all other inputs
and outputs within a [project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) 
folder.  Using an RStudio "project" makes directory oranization easy, decreasing 
reliance on `setwd()` commands in your scripts.  You would not refer to files 
outside of this project folder, but instead would use subfolders (e.g., "data", 
"images", etc.) to organize your work within your project.  

Using project folders also works nicely with version control (Git) as the 
project folder becomes your version control "repository" for that project.

Let's make a new RStudio project named "new_project". In the GUI click:

File --> New Project...

In the dialogue box that appears click:

New Directory --> New Project

We can make "new_project" a subdirectory of: "~/Home" and click "Create Project"

From here if your create a new `.Rmd` file it will automatically be placed 
within the project's working directory. We will also set up a new project in the 
first lab.

The following best practices, used within RStudio projects, promote the 
reproducibility of your work even more.

### Use relative file paths, not full file paths

Best practice is to not include full paths ("C://Project_1/data/raw") to your
files, but uses relative paths ("data/raw") instead, so they will be more
portable -- able to run on someone else's system.  Even better, use
`file.path()` to construct these paths to make them platform independent, so a
person can use, e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux to reproduce your results.
Windows users take note: paths like "C:\\data\\raw" or even "data\\raw will" not
work on a Mac. Use "data/raw", or better yet, `file.path("data", "raw")` to
solve this problem.

```{r file_paths}
#-----file paths---------

# Only works on Windows, as other modern operating systems (macOS, Linux) do 
# not support "drive letters", such as "P:"
full_path <- 'P:\\ENVH556'
full_path <- 'P:/ENVH556'

# Will not work on Windows, exposes your username, and won't work for other 
# users
full_path <- '/Users/joanna/ENVH556'

# If you are curious about what the "~" expands to, you can use path.expand()
full_path_to_home <- path.expand('~')
full_path_to_data <- path.expand('~/ENVH556')

# Will work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, etc., if the file is in the user's
# "home directory"
relative_path <- '~/ENVH556'

```

### Use the working directory

The "working directory" is a directory  associated with your default position or 
location within a file system.  For example, if you tell R to look for a file, it 
assumes you mean within the working directory.  It is convenient to make your 
working directory the highest level directory associated with the files and data 
for an analysis.  Meaning, for example, your `.Rmd` file and the directory 
containing your data are within your working directory.  With RStudio projects, 
this all becomes easier, because the project automatically "sets" the working 
directory.  You can check the working directory at any time with the `getwd()` 
function. 

You can even assign the working directory to a variable, to use with relative 
paths. For example, if you wanted to load an `.rds` data file within a 
hypothetical "Datasets" folder contained within your working directory you could 
do something like this with the helpful `file.path()` function:
```{r relative_path_example, eval=FALSE}
#-----relative path example-----

# assign working directory variable
work_dir <- getwd()

# build relative path to data file
relative_data_path <- file.path(work_dir, "Datasets", "data.rds")

# load data, assign to "df" variable
df <- readRDS(relative_data_path)

```

### Notes on working outside of RStudio projects
When working outside of an RStudio project, you'll have to specify your working 
directory. Just like the automatic organization that comes with using a project, 
you can make your default working directory the location of your `.Rmd` file.  If 
you want to change that default, you can use `setwd()`.  For example, let's 
say my RDS file isn't in the same folder as my `.Rmd`:

```{r setwd_example, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#-----setwd example---------

# Here we use a full file path, but it would be better to use a relative one
setwd("P:/ENVH556")

# Here we use a relative file path, where ".." means "one folder up"
setwd("../ENVH556")

# Here we use a relative file path with file.path(), the recommended method
# because this method supports muliple computing platforms (Windows, Mac, etc.)
setwd(file.path("..", "ENVH556"))

# Now we are ready to read the file
DEMS <- readRDS("DEMSCombinedPersonal.rds")

# You can see that my working directory changed with getwd()
getwd()

```

Using working directories would be especially helpful if you needed to load 
lots of different data files and you didn't want to type out all the file 
paths.  If you always put your `.Rmd` and data files in the same location, you 
should be able to use the default working directory without typing file paths.

One mild word of warning: there are some issues with working directories in R 
Markdown.  If you are having trouble, you may want to make sure that `setwd()` 
is in the same chunk as your `readRDS()` command.  There is also a more 
[elegant solution](http://pbahr.github.io/tips/2016/04/16/fix_rmarkdown_working_directory_issue) 
to this.

## Automate preparation of the working environment

When you write code in R Markdown it needs to be completely self-contained -
that is, it can't rely on anything you loaded, imported, or ran outside of the R
Markdown document, e.g., in your RStudio session. An excellent principle is to
automate the preparation of the working environment in your R Markdown document.
This includes setting options and installing software packages.

### Set `knitr`options

The following chunk is an example of setting `knitr` options. (Note:  We already
set `knitr` options at the beginning of this document.)  

```{r set_knitr_options, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#-----set knitr options-----------

suppressMessages(library(knitr))
opts_chunk$set(tidy=FALSE, cache=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE)

```

You can adjust these to suit your needs at the time of rendering, such as 
disabling echo to make a report for someone who might be distracted by seeing 
R code. Or enable cache once your script is complete and working to allow you 
to more quickly render the script, such as when knitting a slide presentation 
just before you delivering a talk.

For more guidance on `knitr` options, see [knitr
options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) or the [knitr
Reference Card](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/vignettes/knitr-refcard.pdf).

### Install and load packages

A key principle is to only load the packages you will need for your project.  To 
facilitate this, use the `pacman` package in R instead of `install.packages()` 
and `library()`.  This will allow your script to automatically install any 
packages it needs to without forcing the installation of a package which has 
already been installed. Here is an example:

```{r setup_pacman, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#-----setup pacman-----------

# Not evaluated here since done at the beginning of the file
# Load pacman into memory, installing as needed
my_repo <- 'http://cran.r-project.org'
if (!require("pacman")) {install.packages("pacman", repos = my_repo)}

# Load the other packages, installing as needed
pacman::p_load(knitr, tidyverse)

```

The first part installs `pacman` if it is missing, then the second part installs
and loads the other packages as needed. If you do this at the top of your script
for any packages needed later in your script, it makes it really easy for people
to see what packages your script depends on. This approach will make it much
more likely someone, particularly a new R user, will be able to run your script
and reproduce your results. Many new R users get completely stuck if they run
code that bombs simply because a package has not been installed. And just
putting in `install.packages()` calls "just in case" will needlessly slow down
your script (each and every time it is run) if the packages have already been
installed.

## Use inline code

One way to ensure reproducibility is to use in-line code.  This incorporates R
results directly within text.  To include code output in a sentence, we use the
format of one backtick followed by "r", a space, and then some R code, and
ending with a second backtick. For example, we can write: "The mean of the data
is `r mean(a)`."  See Part II for details on inline code.


## Report session information, code, and functions in the Appendix

When you turn in assignments, in addition to your well-written answers (which
should not have any code or raw output), you will need to include the session 
information, embedded code, and functions defined in the .Rmd in a code appendix. 

Both the the `LabReportGuidelines.Rmd` template for ENVH 556 and the appendix 
at the end of this document provides you with example code to 
accomplish this.

### Session Information

At a minimum, your .Rmd should record version numbers of R and your packages 
with `sessionInfo()` at the end of your script.


```
sessionInfo()

```

### Code embedded in the R Markdown file

For ENVH 556, we also want to see all of your code consolidated at the end of
your R Markdown output.  The following code for a chunk header will compile all 
your code into an appendix code listing.  (This next version is for display in 
the rendered document and not for execution.  A working version that is included 
in the appendix of this document.  Note that the chunk header containing these 
options should be a single line of code with no line-wrap.)

```
ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE
```

### Functions defined in the R Markdown file

You should also include a list of functions you created for your analysis (i.e. 
functions used in your analysis that were not part of loaded packages).
```
# Show the names of all functions defined in the .Rmd
# (e.g. loaded in the environment)
lsf.str()

# Show the definitions of all functions loaded into the current environment  
lapply(c(lsf.str()), getAnywhere)

```

Note that there is very little code embedded in these guidelines and no 
functions, so the second two chunks produce little or no oputput.  Generally 
your files will have much longer code appendices.

## Document your code

We encourage you to adopt these best practices when commenting your code to 
improve readability:

  * Comment to keep a running commentary on what your code does.
  * The level of detail should be enough to clarify but not to enough to annoy.
  * Insert comments immediately before the line(s) of code to which they apply.
  * Add spaces and blank lines as needed to separate code and comments.
  * Avoid "side-commenting", putting comments at the end of a line of code.
  * Comments should state what the code does, in the form of an
    [imperative](https://www.wordnik.com/words/imperative).

Here is an example of these put into practice:

```{r comment_example, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#-----comment example-----------

# Create a vector of temperatures in degrees Celcius
temps <- c(21, 22, 20, 19, 19, 19, 22, 19)

# Calculate the mean temperature and standard deviation
mean(temps)
sd(temps)

```

## Follow a consistent style

Choose a code style and be consistent within your .Rmd. Following established 
styles will make your code more readable and easier to follow - for both you 
and others. Here are two popular examples: 

  * The [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) 
  * Google's [R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)
